# Student-Plan-Creator
 By Artificial Brain

## Getting started
To get started you need to run the ```py/Demo.py```.  Keep in mind that the program will prompt you for the file that contains year and semester when the student intends to start classes.

Steps to run the app:
1. Open the project using pyCharm
1. Make sure you set python version to 3.7
1. Create a student file
1. Run the ```py/Demo.py```


### Create a txt file with the following structure.
```
  ____ [FALL, SUMMER, SPRING]
  ____ [2020, 2021, 2022]
  ____ [0, 2, 4]

```
* First line (required): the semester in which you plan to start classes. Options are: SUMMER, FALL or SPRING. 
* Second line (required): the year in which you intend to start classes. Options are: 2009, 2010, 2022, etc ...
* Third line (optional): number of classes that have been taken so far. Not needed for the MVP.

#### Please make sure that your file is in the resource folder.

An example of the file is provided down below:
```
------------------ example.txt ------------------
| FALL
| 2020
| 0
|
-------------------------------------------------
``` 

### Run ```py/Demo.py```
 Go to the py folder and run the main method, which should look like this:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
Right click over and select ```Run Demo``` and you are done.
